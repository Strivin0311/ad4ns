# AD4NS Dataset

This is a new dataset for Neural Symbolic, based on one famous dataset for Autonomous Driving, called [NuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes) 

This dataset describes a simplified task in Autonomous Driving, which takes a camera-captured image as input, going through a 3D objection detection module as the **neural part**, following a path planning module as the **symbolic part**, and finally gives a optimized path to follow as output.

We believe this is a non-trivial example for Neural Symbolic research, and may help to handle the complicated Neural Symbolic hybrid software in the future.
